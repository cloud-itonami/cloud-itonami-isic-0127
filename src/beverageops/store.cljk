(ns beverageops.store
  "Store abstraction for beverage-crop plantation/block planting records.
  Current implementation is an in-memory map; production should migrate to
  Datomic/kotoba-server (the same seam point all cloud-itonami actors use).
  Mirrors `orchardops.store` (cloud-itonami-isic-0122) in shape.

  A registered plantation block is the minimal unit of authority: a
  plantation/block must be registered before ANY proposal referencing it
  can be considered by the Governor (see `beverageops.governor`'s
  `plantation-registered` invariant). Plantation data is opaque to this
  namespace -- callers/backends decide what a plantation record contains
  (name, location, beverage-crop species, planted area, etc); this Store
  only answers \"is this plantation-id registered, and if so what's on
  file\".")

;; Protocol for swappable store implementations
(defprotocol Store
  (registered-plantation [store plantation-id]

    the plantation-id is nil or not registered."))

  (registered-plantation [_store plantation-id]
    (when plantation-id
      (get @plantations plantation-id))))
